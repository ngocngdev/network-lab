Various network related labs
============================

https://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2018-multi-tier-loadbalancer



I use those labs to test various stuff. Most of them are tailored to
my need. The most recent ones are more likely to work than the older
ones.

They are expected to run without being root on top of an up-to-date
Debian sid. Some of them are using User-Mode-Linux, some other are
using KVM.

`lab-generic` should always contain the latest iteration of the lab
and be used as a base for other labs.

Previously, labs were self-contained. This was done to avoid any
breakage when introducing "new features". However, this didn't work as
expected and labs become broken because of external changes (kernel
changes, systemd changes, etc.). Therefore, new labs are now sourcing
some common files (in `common/`). This means that older labs may broke
due to more recent changes. In this case, get the latest commit for a
lab (`git log --oneline -1 lab-generic` for example) and get a
checkout for it (`git checkout 22f22864632a`).

**âš  Warning!** There is a bug in Linux that would prevent the labs
from working when using a kernel 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 or 4.5. This bug is
fixed in kernel 4.6 as well as in 4.4.17.

Other tools
-----------

There exist many other tools to run network labs that may not be as
hacky as this one:

 - [CORE](http://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/ncs/products/core). It uses
   Linux network namespaces and provides a GUI tool. This is a very
   good tool. Please, have a look at it. It doesn't use disk images
   and the whole lab configuration fits into a single file that's easy
   to share. Integration with Quagga or BIRD is very good.

 - [GNS3](http://www.gns3.com/). It uses virtual machines and
   emulators to build the network. It also comes with a GUI tool. You
   can emulate Cisco, Juniper, Arista and other brands network
   equipments. However, it relies heavily on disk images for anything
   else than Cisco devices and it makes it harder to share your work
   on GitHub.

You will find a more comprehensive list (with tests) on [Brian Linkletter's blog](http://www.brianlinkletter.com/open-source-network-simulators/).
